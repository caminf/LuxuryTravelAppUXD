## 1. Introduction

In an era where travel is not just about reaching a destination, but a transformative experience in itself, the Luxury Traveler's App stands as a beacon of opulence and sophistication. This application caters to the discerning tastes of affluent globetrotters, offering a seamless blend of convenience, exclusivity, and unrivaled access to the world's most luxurious destinations and experiences. As we delve into the world of this innovative app, we will discover how it redefines the art of luxury travel, making it an indispensable companion for those who demand nothing less than perfection in their journeys.

With this project we will be focusing on developing an application from the start based on the Elements of the User Experience from Jesse James Garrett to study and learn about this aproach that prioritizes the final user needs.

## 3. Strategy

The first step under the Elements of User Experience is the Strategy plane, which focuses on incorporating not only what the people running the application want to get out of it but what the users want to get out of the application.

### 3.1. Value Proposition Canvas 

From this aproach, a Value Proposition Canvas is used to determined what the people wants to earn from our solution and how are we gonna respond to those needs.

## 4. Scope

### 4.1. UX Personas

The application is designed for users interested in luxurious travel experiences. It caters to both beginners and experienced luxury travelers, providing step-by-step guidance, recommendations, and access to exclusive destinations. Users can keep a detailed record of their travels and enjoy a seamless experience. The app offers advanced features like personalized itineraries and concierge services, making it a versatile solution for those seeking the pinnacle of luxury in their journeys.

### 4.2. Benchmark

To create an application that meets user expectations, it's crucial to analyze existing apps in the market, especially direct competitors. This benchmarking process allows us to identify strengths and weaknesses, learn from competitors' mistakes, and incorporate successful features into our app. By studying competing travel apps, we can design a product that surpasses user expectations.

Benchmarking analysis provides us with an objective perspective and helps us understand market expectations and user demands, ensuring our app delivers an exceptional user experience.

### 5.2. Customer Journey Map

The Customer Journey Map is a valuable tool to understand the user experience in their interaction with our luxury travel app. It helps us identify emotions, needs, and critical moments from the first interaction to subsequent interactions. By immersing ourselves in the user's world, we create memorable experiences and strengthen the relationship with them.

## 6. Skeleton

### 6.1. Wireframes

Wireframes are essential in design and development for several reasons. They provide a visual representation to plan and visualize the structure and layout of our luxury travel app before investing significant resources. They serve as an efficient communication tool, facilitating discussions and aligning expectations among team members and stakeholders. Wireframes support an iterative design process, allowing for quick experimentation and problem-solving while being cost-effective compared to high-fidelity prototypes. They promote user-centered design by prioritizing user needs and goals, resulting in more intuitive and efficient interfaces.
