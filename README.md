## 1. Introduction

In an era where travel is not just about reaching a destination, but a transformative experience in itself, the Luxury Traveler's App stands as a beacon of opulence and sophistication. This application caters to the discerning tastes of affluent globetrotters, offering a seamless blend of convenience, exclusivity, and unrivaled access to the world's most luxurious destinations and experiences. As we delve into the world of this innovative app, we will discover how it redefines the art of luxury travel, making it an indispensable companion for those who demand nothing less than perfection in their journeys.

With this project we will be focusing on developing an application from the start based on the Elements of the User Experience from Jesse James Garrett to study and learn about this aproach that prioritizes the final user needs.

## 3. Strategy

The first step under the Elements of User Experience is the Strategy plane, which focuses on incorporating not only what the people running the application want to get out of it but what the users want to get out of the application.

From this aproach, a Value Proposition Canvas is used to determined what the people wants to earn from our solution and how are we gonna respond to those needs.

## 4. Solutions Scope

The application is designed for users interested in caring for the health of their plants. It is suitable for both beginners and experienced hobbyists. It provides step-by-step tips for plant care, including basic and advanced information. It allows you to keep a detailed record of your plants and track their progress. It also offers advanced features, such as pruning techniques and pest control. In short, it is a versatile application that helps users to effectively care for their plants and improve their gardening skills.

## 5. Benchmark

In order to develop an application that meets the expectations and needs of users, it is essential to carry out an exhaustive analysis of existing applications on the market, especially those that are direct competitors. This process, known as benchmarking, allows us to identify both the shortcomings and the positive aspects of these applications, in order to integrate them optimally into our own product.

By studying competing applications, we can learn from their mistakes and avoid repeating them in our application. In addition, we can identify successful features and functionalities that we can adopt and implement in our solution, thus providing a superior experience to our users.

Benchmarking analysis provides us with an objective perspective and helps us understand market expectations and user demands. By leveraging this information, we can design and develop an application that stands out from the competition and effectively meets the needs and aspirations of our users.

In short, benchmarking analysis allows us to recognize the strengths and weaknesses of competing applications, optimally integrating the positive aspects and avoiding the identified mistakes. This helps us to create an application that aligns with market expectations and delivers an exceptional user experience.

## 6. Customer Journey Map

The Customer Journey Map is a valuable tool to understand the user experience in their interaction with our product or service. Through the detailed mapping of each stage, from the first contact to the subsequent interaction, we can identify emotions, needs and critical moments. This analysis highlights challenges and opportunities to improve the experience and design exceptional solutions. By immersing ourselves in the user's world, we create memorable experiences and strengthen the relationship with them.

## 8. Wireframes

Wireframes are essential in design and development for several reasons. They provide a visual representation that helps plan and visualize the structure and layout of a product or website before investing significant resources. They serve as an efficient communication tool, facilitating discussions and aligning expectations among team members and stakeholders. Also support an iterative design process, allowing for quick experimentation and problem-solving while being cost-effective compared to high-fidelity prototypes. Lastly, wireframes promote user-centered design by prioritizing user needs and goals, resulting in more intuitive and efficient interfaces.

## 9. Mockups

This section shows the mockups developed as a solution, for a better visualization visit the project in figma together with its functionalities [here](https://www.figma.com/file/qoBtWThrPUKcvd6hiCrm5K/Plantitas?type=design&mode=design&t=8niDRsvgzT9YFEe0-0).

### 9.1. Initial Aproach

Initially, we tried to cover all of our users needs, offering them with all the features needed to satisfy their petitions studied previously. Here are the essentials views that cover these requirements:

Home.

### 9.2. Improved Mockups

After our first aproach, the project was involved in a feedback process. By using Usability Testing like Heuristic metrics shared by our co-workers and improving the first design focused on accessibility, we developed some new features like 'Dark Mode', sensors features and more.

Here are some examples:

Home - Dark Mode
